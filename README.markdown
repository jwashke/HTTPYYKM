HTTP: Yeah You Know Me, is a week long project where Josh Washke and Marina Corona build a web application.

The web application is capable of:
-receiving a request from a user
-understanding the request's intent and source
-generating a response (like "Hello, World!(0)" or identifying if a word is valid)
-sending the response to the user
